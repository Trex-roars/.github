# T-rex - Innovators of Code

Welcome to **T-rex**, a team of passionate developers who love to build creative and innovative solutions using the power of TypeScript (TS) and Python (PY). Our team is driven by curiosity, a love for learning, and a desire to create new things that inspire and solve real-world problems.

## ü¶ñ About T-rex

T-rex is a small yet powerful team of 3 members dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with **TypeScript** and **Python**. We're not afraid of a challenge, and we enjoy working on both cutting-edge tech projects and playful, experimental endeavors. At T-rex, we believe in **building cool things**, making things **better**, and constantly evolving.

While TypeScript is our language of choice for front-end and full-stack applications, Python is our go-to for back-end development, data science, automation, and anything related to machine learning or AI.

We also love creating projects that are fun and full of surprises. We are particularly interested in **Rags** ‚Äî an area of innovation that combines creativity with problem-solving.

## üíª Technologies We Use

- **TypeScript (TS)**: Modern JavaScript with type safety, great for building scalable and robust applications.
- **Python (PY)**: Used for everything from back-end development, automation, machine learning, AI, data analysis, and more.
- **Rags**: Our unique approach to building innovative projects (still in development, but we‚Äôll explain more as we go).

## üöÄ Projects

We work on a variety of exciting projects. Some of them include:

- **Full-Stack Applications**: From designing sleek user interfaces in TypeScript with React or Vue, to building robust back-end APIs with Python (Flask/Django).
- **Data Science**: Exploring and analyzing data, making predictions, and developing machine learning models using Python.
- **Automation Tools**: Writing Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks, scraping data, and more.
- **Rags-related Projects**: A mysterious and experimental area of innovation that we will reveal as time goes on! Stay tuned!

## üìÇ Our Workflow

- **Agile Development**: We follow agile methodologies, adapting to the needs of the project and working collaboratively.
- **Version Control**: Git is our best friend. We use GitHub to host all of our repositories, and we practice good version control for efficient collaboration.
- **Code Reviews**: We value quality and readability in our code, and we encourage regular peer reviews.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: We have automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying our applications.
